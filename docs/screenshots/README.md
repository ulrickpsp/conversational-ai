## Tips for Best Screenshots

1. **Use a clean browser window** — No bookmarks bar, extensions, or distracting tabs
2. **Zoom level:** 100% (or 125% for high-DPI displays)
3. **Theme:** The app uses dark mode, make sure it's clearly visible
4. **Sample content:** Use an interesting proposal (e.g., "Create a triangular arbitrage strategy between DEX and CEX for stablecoins") to show meaningful debate content
5. **File format:** PNG for best quality
6. **Compression:** Optimize PNGs with tools like TinyPNG before committing to keep repo size reasonable
